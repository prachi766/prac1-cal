This is a simple calculator program written in Java. I built it step by step to make it easy to use and maintain. 
First, I planned the main functions needed: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
I wrote separate methods for each operation so the code would stay clean and reusable. 
Next, I added a Scanner to accept user input from the keyboard. To decide which operation to perform, I used a switch statement where the operator (+, -, *, /) triggers the correct method. 
I also added error handling to prevent division by zero. To make it more user-friendly, I wrapped everything inside a while loop so that multiple calculations can be performed without restarting the program. 
Finally, I added clear prompts, result display, and an option to exit when the user is done.
How to Run
1. Save the code in a file named Calculator.java.
2. Open a terminal/command prompt in the same directory.
3. Compile the code:
4. Run the program:
